## BANNER
Interesting use of a copybook full 'o big characters. 

Evolves to conceptually demonstrate how to:

1. Use WORKING STORAGE
2. Manage a SINGLE-DIMENSIONAL "Table" (array)
3. Understand a MULTI-DIMENSIONAL Table
4. Define a "master detail" character array ðŸ˜‰
5. Redefine a locus ðŸ˜‰ for global usage
6. Create + CALL a Library (.so)
7. Properly manage a LINKAGE SECTION
8. Use NESTED copy books
9. See how 01 REDEFINES = superior re-use (!)
10. Use "THE" RETURN-CODE
11. Return your own "88 state"
12. Use a Makefile

Justified the use of a multi-dimensional array ('table') in Modern COBOL.

## zPlaylist & Training
These and many other 'self-teaching' examples will be part of the [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLItP5KoawLqnjcEVGIhF6FEj8NIBTNjZ3).
These and many other 'help-me-learn' examples will be part of the [Udemy Training](https://www.udemy.com/course/simply-cobol/?referralCode=EA98738662CCF9535E2B) - FREE until we exceed Udemy's official two (2) hour limit.

So sign up for the 'Udemy whilst [Modern COBOL: Professional Programmer's Fast-Track](https://www.udemy.com/course/simply-cobol/?referralCode=EA98738662CCF9535E2B) is still a work in progress (or until I land [my next opportunity](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nagyspace/) - whichever comes first ;)?

### De-facto Standards?
I believe that RETURN-CODE and nested copy books are each universally supported? -So too for a 01 REDEFINES in WORKING STORAGE. 

Please correct me if your COBOL implementation disagrees - and thanks!

## Makefile Order, Matters!
See the [Makefile](https://github.com/soft9000/COBOL/blob/main/TheCommons/BANNER/Makefile) for which-goeth-wherz. --Note that the orderng therein is the order to review each evolutionary concept.

If you are new to using make / Makefiles, then I've an [educational opportunity available](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-gnu-tool-primer/?referralCode=E858B2C2AC9CD872A100) that you might enjoy.
