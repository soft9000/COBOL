## Backstory?
Yes, I've a full-time job as a software consultant .... Yet ever interested in ushering others into our higher paying I.T world, working with a client it occurred to me that the planet needs replacements for retiring COBOL gurus?

So I am creating an educational opportunity for GnuCOBOL as an official side-hustle.

As you may know, GnuCOBOL is the officially-supported version for AWS that runs ... everywhere. But not everything GNU goes everywhere, so - with your help - we're tryng to triage.
